Design Decisions
----------------
The ELM codebase tries to accomplish as much as possible while remaining as concise as possible. Where feasible, I am outsourcing functionality such as [tagging](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on), [commenting](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on), [following](https://github.com/tcocca/acts_as_follower/), [liking](https://github.com/cavneb/make_flaggable), [messaging](https://github.com/ging/mailboxer), etc. to a gem. The majority of the gems I'm using are well tested. Ideally, those that are not should, at a later date, have their functionality replicated within ELM or modify the functionality of the gem itself.

Every Last Morsel currently makes heavy use of [InheritedResouces](https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources) to create polymorphic controllers. I may convert these to custom polymorphic controllers or modify InheritedResouces itself to meet any future needs.

The heavy use of polymorphic controllers is necessitated by the highly contextualized design. Each object can be viewed in multiple contexts: in the context of itself, in the context of a user profile, or in the context of a plot profile. To enable using a single polymorphic controller for these different views I make use of the ["Optional Belongs To"](https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources#optional-belongs-to) functionality within InheritedResources. This allows each resource to not only be nested, accesed in the context of its parent, but also to be independent, accessed in the context of itself.

In an effort to maintain relatively logicless views and keep thin controllers, instead of adding conditionals to change the view within the controller OR conditionals within the view to change the content, I added a "context" to each view.

To elaborate, this is the folder structure for a particular resource (Crops).

    * app/views/crops
        * partials
            * _index, _new, _show, _edit, _form
        * plots
            * index, new, show, edit, _form
        * users
            * index, new, show, edit, _form

Instead of routing to app/views/plot\_crop\_varieties/#{action}.slim, I'm routing to app/views/crops/#{context}/#{action}.slim.

To accomplish this change I made a small override to the render function within ApplicationController like so:

    def render(*args)

    # Check if controller inherits from InheritedResources::Base
    # If so, change view route to prepend "#{context}"
    # to serve the correct view.

    if self.class.ancestors.include? InheritedResources::Base
      context = parent? ? parent_class.to_s.pluralize : "self" # parent_type.to_s.capitalize.pluralize
      path = "#{controller_name}/#{context}/#{action_name}"
    end

    options = args.extract_options!
    options[:template] = path if context != nil
    super(*(args << options))
    end

Servers
---------------
    Development: dev.everylastmorsel.com -> dev-everylastmorsel.herokuapp.com
    Alpha: alpha.everylastmorsel.com -> alpha-everylastmorsel.herokuapp.com ** currently disabled
    Beta: beta.everylastmorsel.com -> beta-everylastmorsel.herokuapp.com
    Main: everylastmorsel.com -> everylastmorsel.herokuapp.com

    Staging: elm.herokuapp.com

Currently using simple shell script (h.sh) to push environment variables to all servers (via figaro).

    echo "rake figaro:heroku[$DEV]";    SKIP_RAILS_ADMIN_INITIALIZER=true rake figaro:heroku\[$DEV\]
    echo "rake figaro:heroku[$STAGE]";  SKIP_RAILS_ADMIN_INITIALIZER=true rake figaro:heroku\[$STAGE\]
    echo "rake figaro:heroku[$ALPHA]";  SKIP_RAILS_ADMIN_INITIALIZER=true rake figaro:heroku\[$ALPHA\]
    echo "rake figaro:heroku[$BETA]";   SKIP_RAILS_ADMIN_INITIALIZER=true rake figaro:heroku\[$BETA\]
    echo "rake figaro:heroku[$MASTER]"; SKIP_RAILS_ADMIN_INITIALIZER=true rake figaro:heroku\[$MASTER\]

Because facebook only allows a single server to link to an application, the h.sh script also reconfigures the _FACEBOOK\_APPID_ and _FACEBOOK\_APPSECRET_ for each server to allow fb login within all* environments. (* just Dev and Beta for now)
