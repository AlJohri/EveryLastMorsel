        | There’s a lot of talk about local, sustainable food, but not a lot of information on where you can get it. We’re digging up the underground urban gardening scene and bringing it to the surface with Every Last Morsel, a powerful and easy-to-use tool to manage, track and purchase fresh produce. We’ve got the gardening game covered by enabling users to not only keep track of their own plants but cultivate a community and share the fruits of their labor with others. Whether you consider yourself a big-time gardner, a budding green thumb, or just a fresh ingredient lover, Every Last Morsel is for you.
