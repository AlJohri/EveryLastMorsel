    %h1.turquiose A Little Bit About Us.
    %p 
      Every Last Morsel began as a landscaping service oddly enough, and that landscaping service began with an assumption. Todd expected a great many people would love to have their own garden and grow their own food, but they simply didn't have the time or the knowledge to do it themselves. If there's room enough to grow grass, then why not grow food? And if lawn mowing services exist, then why can't farming services too?

      It wasn't long before Todd's list of clients grew quite large. Weeding here; watering there; squashing bugs and building beds kept him rather busy. And to remember which vegetables grew where was about as much fun as playing with a spreadsheet, which is not very fun at all.

      Enter Collin - Todd's high school friend and fellow gardener. As luck
      would have it, he's also quite a talented web developer. Todd pitched
      his idea for a web application to Collin. An application that would
      allow him to map garden locations and list the plant varieties growing
      in each. But expectations didn't remain so modest for long. Todd and
      Collin realized that the concept would be much more interesting, if
      they built it as an open network for everyone - green thumbs and
      foodies alike - because the fun in growing food is sharing it after
      all. And if they made it easy for people to share food, then maybe
      people would be inclined grow more of it!

      The rest, as they say, is history, but here's where the story gets
      really interesting, because you get to choose where it goes from here.
      I don't mean to suggest that you're faced with a choice of donating
      money or buying a latte - though we certainly hope you choose the
      former. Your opportunity to be involved is much greater than that;
      because Every Last Morsel has evolved into a community of people
      inspired to transform their communities by Good Eating. And I can't
      think of a more delicious way to do good than that.
